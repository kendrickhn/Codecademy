# Warby Parker Customer Journey Insights

## 1. Quiz Funnel Analysis

| Question                             | Response Count | Drop-off Rate |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1. What are you looking for?         | 500            | -             |
| 2. What's your fit?                  | 475            | 5%            |
| 3. Which shapes do you like?         | 380            | 20%           |
| 4. Which colors do you like?         | 361            | 5%            |
| 5. When was your last eye exam?      | 270            | 25%           |

**Observations:**

- **Initial Engagement:** All 500 users responded to the first question, indicating strong initial interest.
- **Progressive Drop-off:** The most significant decreases occur between questions 2 and 3 (20%) and questions 4 and 5 (25%).

**Insights:**

- **Complexity and Sensitivity:** The higher drop-off rates at questions 3 and 5 suggest that users may find questions about personal preferences (shapes) and personal health information (eye exams) either too complex or intrusive. Simplifying these questions or providing context about their importance could improve completion rates.

## 2. Home Try-On and Purchase Conversion Analysis

| Number of Pairs | Users Started Quiz | Home Try-On Participants | Purchases Made | Try-On Conversion Rate | Purchase Conversion Rate |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3 pairs         | 379                | 379                      | 201            | 100%                   | 53%                      |
| 5 pairs         | 371                | 371                      | 294            | 100%                   | 79%                      |

**Observations:**

- **Try-On Participation:** All users who reached the Home Try-On stage participated, indicating the program's appeal.
- **Purchase Rates:** Users who tried 5 pairs had a higher purchase rate (79%) compared to those who tried 3 pairs (53%).

**Insights:**

- **Increased Options Lead to Higher Purchases:** Offering more frames for trial correlates with higher purchase rates. This suggests that providing a broader selection may help customers find a pair they like, increasing the likelihood of purchase.

## Recommendations

- **Optimize Quiz Design:** Review and possibly rephrase or simplify questions 3 and 5 to reduce drop-off rates. Providing explanations for why certain information is requested may also help.
- **Enhance Home Try-On Program:** Consider promoting the 5-pair option more prominently, as it is associated with higher conversion rates.
- **Personalized Follow-Ups:** Implement targeted follow-up communications for users who drop off at specific quiz stages or do not proceed to purchase after the Home Try-On, addressing potential concerns or offering assistance.
